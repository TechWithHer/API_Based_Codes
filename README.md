# 🌐 API_BASED_CODES

This repository contains a collection of beginner-to-intermediate level Python projects built using public APIs. Each script demonstrates how to fetch, process, and display data from external services, making it a great hands-on introduction to working with APIs in Python.

## 🔧 Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or above
- `requests` module (for API calls)
- API keys (for some scripts like currency converter or flight search)

Install required libraries using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
You may need to create a .env file or edit variables inside scripts to add your API keys.

🧠 Project Overview
Script Name	Description
1_Weather_Info.py	Fetches real-time weather information for a given city using OpenWeather API.
2_Crypto_Price_Tracker.py	Tracks current prices of cryptocurrencies (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum).
3_Random_Joke_Generator.py	Fetches a random joke from a public joke API and displays it.
4_Currency_Converter.py	Converts currencies using exchange rate APIs (like ExchangeRate-API).
5_Flight_Search_App.py	Searches flights between cities/dates using a flight data API.
6_Image_Analyzer_Tool.py	Analyzes image content using a vision-based API (e.g., Google Vision API).

🔐 API Keys & Setup
Some scripts require API keys. Visit the respective API provider sites and sign up for free keys:

OpenWeatherMap: https://openweathermap.org/api

CoinGecko / CoinMarketCap for crypto data

ExchangeRate-API or similar for currency

Tequila API (by Kiwi.com) for flight search

Google Cloud Vision or similar for image analysis

Store your keys securely and avoid hardcoding them in scripts.

🚀 How to Run
bash

Edit
python3 1_Weather_Info.py
Replace the script name with any of the six to try out different tools.

📌 Goals
Learn how to integrate external APIs into Python scripts.

Practice HTTP requests, JSON parsing, and CLI output.

Build real-world utility scripts.
